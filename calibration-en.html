                            <p>Tomasz consistently exceeds expectations and has been in his current role for 5 years. After returning from a 4-month leave, he maintains work-life balance while deepening his knowledge in his role. Despite the break, he still navigates strategic business topics smoothly and expresses a strong desire to expand his scope of responsibilities and take on greater managerial responsibilities.</p>
                            
                            <p>As his manager, you recognize his leadership potential and his ability to build relationships with employees from different departments, effectively connecting teams to achieve results. Tomasz excels at building strong client relationships, demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs, including financial aspects. He is highly motivated to develop his career, collaborate in a team, and eagerly seeks new approaches that can contribute to success.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key question:</strong> Although Tomasz shows great potential to take on greater managerial responsibilities, there are some concerns. The potential is visible, but to fully assume a leadership position, he must prove he can handle additional responsibility for making strategic decisions that come with the future role.</p>

                    <h3>📋 Case Study #5: Katarzyna - Project Coordinator</h3>
                </div>
                
                <div class="case-layout">
                    <div class="case-description">
                        <div class="case-context">
                            <h4>💡 Note - Narrative format (advanced level):</h4>
                            <p>This case study is more challenging - information is not organized by questions. You must draw appropriate conclusions from the description below.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-narrative" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                            <p>Katarzyna has been with the company for 7 years and has been a Project Coordinator in the operations department for 4 years. During this time, she has become the "backbone" of the team - you can count on her in any situation. Her projects are always delivered on time, documentation is perfect, and internal clients praise her for reliability and predictability. Katarzyna achieves her goals at 95-100% every quarter, though she rarely exceeds them. When asked why, she responds: "Why promise more when you can solidly deliver what's planned?"</p>

                            <p>In tense situations - e.g., when a client changes requirements at the last moment or when results need to be delivered under time pressure - Katarzyna remains calm and professional. She doesn't panic, systematically solving problems one by one. The team values her emotional stability. On the other hand, in these hot moments, Katarzyna sticks to proven procedures and doesn't experiment with new solutions, even if they could speed up work. "Better safe than fast" - that's her motto.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to collaboration, Katarzyna is polite, available, and helpful. She responds to emails the same day, participates in meetings prepared, and always keeps commitments to other teams. However, she's not someone who naturally connects people or initiates cross-departmental collaboration. She waits for someone to contact her, rather than coming up with proposals herself. In the manager's opinion, she's a "solid team player," but not someone who drives collaboration.</p>

                            <p>Katarzyna's communication is clear and precise, especially in written form. The reports she prepares are exemplary - complete, understandable, error-free. In verbal communication, she's less confident, especially in larger groups. During a presentation to management, it was clear she felt uncomfortable. She prefers working "behind the scenes" - preparing documents, coordination, administration - rather than being on the front line.</p>

                            <p>Interestingly, Katarzyna shows no greater interest in new tools or project methodologies. When the company introduced a new project management system, she learned it, but only to the extent necessary to do her job. She didn't explore additional features or look for ways to use the system more efficiently. At the Agile training, she came because it was mandatory, but later told the manager: "It's interesting, but our Waterfall has been working for years, why change?"</p>

                            <p>In development conversations, Katarzyna says she's satisfied with her role. When the manager asked if she'd considered taking on a Project Manager role (a higher position with responsibility for budget and team), she replied: "I prefer to coordinate rather than manage. I like having a clear scope and don't want to be responsible for business decisions." She doesn't participate in development programs beyond her current role and doesn't volunteer for cross-functional projects that could expand her competencies.</p>

                            <p>A few months ago, a problem arose with the reporting process - reports were delayed by 2 days, blocking the finance team. Katarzyna identified that the problem lay in delays from the sales team. Instead of proposing a process change or talking directly with sales about earlier deadlines, she escalated the topic to her manager and waited for his intervention. The problem was solved, but only after two weeks.</p>

                            <p>Katarzyna has deep knowledge of project processes in the company - she knows every form, every step, every procedure. She's a "walking encyclopedia" of how things are done. But when non-standard projects appear - e.g., hybrid ones combining IT and operations elements - she admits it's not her strong suit. "Let someone with a broader perspective handle this" - she said recently.</p>

                            <p>Katarzyna's manager summarizes: "Katarzyna is an absolutely reliable person. I know that if I assign her something within her scope, it will be done perfectly and on time. But I don't see the fire in her - the desire to take on greater responsibility, initiate something new, step outside her comfort zone. She's exactly where she wants to be, and it seems that's completely enough for her."</p>
